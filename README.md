# Recovering When Locked Out
Should a situation occur where you are unable to authenticate, you can use the section below to regain access to the system. You should note that the the IP Restriction Manager is always disabled if the user is logging in from `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

## On-Site

### Option 1 - Database Update
If you have database access, you can run the following database query to disable all restrictions:
```
UPDATE irm_iprestrictionmanager SET status = 'Disabled' WHERE deleted = 0;
```

### Option 2 - File Change
If you have file system access, modify the function `validateAPI` in `./modules/IRM_IPRestrictionManager/IRM_IPRestrictionManager.php` to return before the validation logic:
```
public function validateAPI($api, $username, $platform)
{
    return;
    ...
}
```

## Sugar cloud
If you are On-Demand, you will need to submit a support ticket by logging into http://www.sugarcrm.com/support/portal. Please describe the issue you are experiencing, reference the IP Restriction Manager, and provide a link to this documentation.

# Using the Module
Documentation on the use and administration of ip restrictions.

## Navigating to the IP Restriction Manager
The Ip Restriction Module is only accessible to system administrators. An administrator can navigate to the module in two different ways.
1. Navigating directly to `/#IRM_IPRestrictionManager` in the browsers url
2. Navigating to `Admin > IP Restriction Management`

## Administering IP Restrictions
To create a restriction, you will need to click “Create” from the IP Restriction Modules submenu tabs. New restrictions will be in effect when current users refresh the browser or reauthenticate.

The fields presented on the quick create are outlines below:

### IP Range 
Type: Text

The IP restrictions you would like to implement. Valid restriction types are:
* Specific IP format: 1.2.3.4
* Wildcard format: 1.2.3.*
   * you may use `*` or `*.*.*.*` to signify any ip address
* CIDR format: 1.2.3/24  OR  1.2.3.4/255.255.255.0
* Start-End IP format: 1.2.3.4-1.2.3.5 

### Status
Type: Dropdown

Whether or not the restriction is enabled/disabled. If the status is ‘Disabled’, the restriction will not be in effect.

### Platforms
Type: Multi-Select

The allowed platforms a user is allowed to authenticate to. Available options are:
* All - all platforms
* Base (Sugar) - Sugar UI only
* Mobile - Mobile devices only

#### Adding Platforms
Adminitrators may need to add additional supported platforms to account for intergrations and plugins. To achieve this, navigate to `Admin > Dropdown Editor` and find the `ip_restriction_platforms_list` dropdown list. Next, add the new platform type making sure that the `Item Name` field matches the platform type being passed to the Sugar REST v10 API. You can make the `Display Label` field anything you would like. Click save when done.

### Description
Type: Text

A description of the restriction for administrative use.
